Abstract: Elder abuse continues to be a taboo, mostly underestimated, ignored by societies across the world. Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have revealed significant variations in the prevalence of elder abuse, with large geographic variations. This is the first study that compares the prevalence of elder abuse and risk factors between a European and Asian countries and using the same method. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in Spain and Iran. Eight hundred forty subjects, aged 65 and over, were chosen randomly from patients in primary care health centres. Prevalence of abuse and subtypes and risk factors were obtained using structured interviews. To minimize the potential effects of selection bias, a propensity score matching was performed. Multiple correspondence analysis was used to evaluate the possible relationships among all the variables and to identify specific profiles. Five hundred thirty-two older people remained for the analysis after matching. The prevalence of abuse was 39.1% in Spain and 80.5% in Iran. Elder abuse and its subtypes are significantly more probable in Iran than in Spain. Out of every five elderly people questioned, two in Spain and four in Iran responded affirmatively to a question concerning elder abuse. Multiple correspondence analysis allows the differences between patterns of elder abuse between both populations to be visualized. Elder abuse is a prevalent problem in Spain and Iran. While some characteristics are shared in the pattern of abuse there are different profiles between the two countries. Detecting elder abuse should be a priority objective in clinical and forensic setting.
