Resumén: The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  analyze  the  proposal  of  the  textbook Mathematics  1, Secondary Educationof the Ministry of Education of the Dominican Republic for the teaching of the linear equation with one variable. The methodology employed is based on the use of tools from the Anthropological Theory of the Didactic, devised by Chevallard, which constitutes the theoretical framework for the present study,  and  which  have  enabled  us  to  identify  certain  aspects  related  to  the  mathematical organisation  proposed  in  the textbook.  The  results  indicate  that  the  proposed  and  solved activities contained in the analysed unit obey a mathematical organisation more located in the practical block than in the theoretical block. This implies a rational justification of how to make the  task  more  intelligible,  which  would  require  the  incorporation  of  novel  and  challenging praxeologies that would mobilise the critical-analytical sense of the participants.
