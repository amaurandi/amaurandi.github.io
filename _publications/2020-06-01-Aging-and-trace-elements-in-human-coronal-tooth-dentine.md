Abstract: Teeth are a fundamental tool in forensic odontology for identification in a legal context of those individuals who cannot be identified visually or by other means. Dentine presents physiological exchanges of in trace elements after a period of mineralization and several factors can affect its concentration. The aim of this study was to investigate the concentration of 25 trace elements in the coronal dentine according to sex and type of tooth to determine their relationship with age. A total of 25 trace elements were analyzed in 150 human coronal dentine. Teeth were classified into three age groups, sex and tooth type. The trace elements were grouped as potentially toxic or essential. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry and Atomic Emission Spectroscopy were used. The toxic and essential elements were detected in the following order of concentration: Al > Pb > Sn > Li > As > Cd and Ca > P > Mg > Na > S > K > Sr > Zn > Ba > Fe > B > Ti > Mn > Cr > Ni > Cu > Co > Se > V. Our findings show an increase in the concentration of toxic (Pb, Li and Sn) and essential (B, Ba, K, Sr, S and Mg) elements in coronal dentin related to the age of the teeth, regardless of sex. The concentrations of Pb and K in dentin of molars and premolars are the elements that best relate their variations with age. In view of our results, the analysis of these trace elements in dentin in combination with other types of techniques could be established as an element to consider in age dating studies in different forensic situations.
