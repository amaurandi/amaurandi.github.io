Abstract: This study explores the perceptions of primary EFL (English as a foreign language)
trainee teachers on the potential of poetry as an instrument to enhance their knowledge
of English. The aim was to determine whether or not learners’ opinions coincided with
theoretical principles established by scholars in favour of using literature in EFL
classrooms. An 18-item questionnaire was distributed to 270 trainees to obtain
quantitative and qualitative data on alleged linguistic, motivational and intercultural
benefits. The results confirm that trainees believe poetry-based English lessons to be
more useful for developing language skills, pronunciation, grammatical and lexical
knowledge than for intercultural or motivational gains. The present study contributes to
the academic expansion of the field in two main ways: i) by providing evidence which
empirically tests the predominantly theoretical drive of work available to date; and ii) by
offering a systematic and holistic exploration of the potential advantages of poetry
which goes beyond the methodologically inconsistent and fragmentary views offered by
existing research.
