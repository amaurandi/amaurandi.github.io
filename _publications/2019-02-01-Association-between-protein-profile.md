Abstract: Proteomic techniques in bones forensic samples are increasingly, being applied. The main aim of forensic sciences is the estimation of postmortem interval. Most current techniques are useful for the first post-mortem stages. However, in the case of osseous remains, these techniques may be difficult to use due to the high level of decomposition of the sample. Our objective was to attempt to know whether there is a protein profile in human bone remains that would enable a late postmortem. interval ranging from 5 to 20 years postmortem to be estimated. A total of 40 femur bones from 40 different cadavers (data range 5-20 years) were use. Of the 275 total proteins, we excluded the circulating ones (n = 227), leaving a total of 48 proteins (29 structural and 19 functional) were found. A multiple correspondence analysis was applied on the 48 proteins. Finally selecting 32 proteins that allowed us to discriminate between the. two groups of postmortem interval. Analysis of the protein profile present in bone permits an approximation of the date of death within the studied interval, and could be used to complement other tests for estimating the postmortem interval.
