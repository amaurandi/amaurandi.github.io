Objective: To investigate the relationship among self-reported oral hygiene habits, dental decay, and periodontal condition among pregnant women.
Method: In a cross-sectional study, a structured questionnaire and dental examination were used to assess pregnant women's knowledge of oral health and attitudes to oral hygiene, in addition to their dental and periodontal condition. Data were collected from 337 pregnant women living in Murcia in southeast Spain.
Results: The questionnaire was completed by 337 women, 282 of whom also had an oral examination. More than 57% were in their first pregnancy, their mean age was 30 years, and most (80.1%) were Spanish with a medium-high educational level. Most of the pregnant woman (84%) brushed their teeth 2 or 3 times a day, and a third (30.9%) used a mouthwash daily. The pregnant women who self-reported having good or very good dental health had a lower level of active decay (P < 0.001) and a lower periodontal index (P < 0.001).
Conclusion: In the present study, there was a significant correlation between a high level of self-reported oral health in pregnant women and low levels of dental decay and low periodontal indexes.
