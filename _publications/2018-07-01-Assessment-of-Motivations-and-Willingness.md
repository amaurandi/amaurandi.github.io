The motivations of participants recruited for research, especially from potentially vulnerable populations, have received increasing attention. The present investigation compares the motivations and willingness to participate in research of 134 psychiatric outpatients and 50 controls. The willingness to participate of both groups was similar. We found a higher proportion of psychiatric admissions and a higher degree of computer literacy among those willing to participate. Regardless of their decision concerning participation, the reasons given by the members of both groups were logical and concordant with the related literature. This suggests that negative views about the motivations of psychiatric patients to act as research participants are unfounded. Efforts should focus on the predictors of willingness to participate that we have identified for improving recruitment. The implications of these results for research are discussed.
